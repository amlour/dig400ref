# DIGIT 400 - Web dev class 

### Hey hey. This code was made with love in the DIGIT program at Penn State Behrend
### If you find that this code is useful or helpful, drop me a line and let me know.

## UPDATE - this site is now inaccessible, as it's expensive to keep up. I've left some screenshots to show how it looked when it was still up. Thanks! :)
